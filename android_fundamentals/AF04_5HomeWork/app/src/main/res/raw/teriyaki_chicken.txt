<PREPARATION>
1. How to cook the chicken

　Pierce the skin side of the chicken with a fork and cook directly in a pan without seasoning.　The basic recipe of teriyaki chicken is to cook about 80% of the chicken directly first and then add the teriyaki sauce.

　This is because the flavor of the sauce does not macerate when the chicken is still uncooked.　Therefore, first cook the skin side of the chicken until the skin is browned and then turn the chicken over to cook the other side. At this stage, the grease will pour out from the chicken skin, so make sure to wipe the grease off with paper towel.

2. Adding the sauce

　Once the chicken is well cooked (about 80%), pour the teriyaki sauce into the frying pan from the rim of the frying pan.　Turn down the heat from medium to low and simmer until the sauce becomes thick and has a shiny look.

　You can see that the big bubbles will turn into small bubbles when the sauce is thickened.　At this stage, pour the sauce several times over the skin side of the chicken using a spoon to let the flavor blend in and also to add luster to the skin side of the chicken.　When the sauce is thickened and is no longer left in the frying pan, it is ready to be served.　Garnish with boiled okra.
