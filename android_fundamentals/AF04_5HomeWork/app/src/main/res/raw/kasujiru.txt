<INGREDIENTS>
- About 200g of sake kasu (sake lees)
- Appropriate amount of shiro miso (white miso)
- 1 to 1.5 liter of dashi made from konbu (dried kelp) and shiitake mushroom
　 * use 1 konbu 10cm×5cm and about 4 dried shiitake mushrooms soaked in water
- About 200g of salmon
- Appropriate amount of root vegetables such as daikon radish, turnip and carrot
- 2 aburaage
- Appropriate amount of long green onion


<PREPARATION>

1. Preparing the ingredients

　Sake kasu is a byproduct when making Japanese sake and therefore there is a big difference in its taste.　You can make kasu jiru with kasu paste you often find at supermarkets, but I recommend using sake kasu made at sake breweries, which produces good Japanese sake but not in large volume since the aroma is better.

　The preparation process depends on the firmness of sake kasu.　If it is soft, put it in a bowl with some dashi and smash it up as shown in the picture below.

* If you are using hard sheets of sake kasu, soak it in dashi for a while or you can grind it using mortar.　Sake kasu can be frozen.　If you find good sake lees, you’d better buy extra!

　The ingredients to put in are salmon, root vegetables (daikon radish, turnip, carrot, burdock root etc.) and aburaage.　Cut the salmon, which will be the main ingredient, into large pieces and the rest into bite size pieces.　If you have long green onion, slice it thinly for garnish and it will add color to the dish.

2. Mixing the eggs

　Soak the dried kelp and shiitake mushroom in water for several hours and cut the shiitake mushroom into bite size pieces.　Strain the dashi to remove any dust from the shiitake mushroom and put it on low heat.

　Bring it to a simmer and add the vegetable that takes long time to cook first.　When the vegetables are cooked, add salmon and aburaage.　After the salmon is cooked, add the melted sake kasu using a strainer.　To finish the recipe, taste the soup and add shiro miso and it’s ready to serve.
