- 1 block of ginger
- About 3 tablespoons of potato starch
- Appropriate amount of lemon or other citrus fruit

<Preparation>

1. Preparing the chicken and the seasoning

　Cut the chicken into bit-size pieces.

　Put the chicken into a bowl and add the juice of the grated ginger into the same bowl.

　Next, add the marinade made from soy sauce and sake at the proportion of 2 to 1. Pour the marinade over the chicken until it is covered. (The marinade doesn't need to be fully covered. We will rub it into the chicken afterwards.) Let marinate for about 20 minutes. Mix well by rubbing the chicken into the marinade occasionally.

　* Be careful not to marinate too long, as the chicken will become too salty when fried. Change the time for marinating according to the saltiness of the soy sauce you will be using.
After 20 minutes, drain the marinade but not all of it. Leaving some over is important.

　Leave 10 to 20 % of the marinade, as it will become the seasoning of the coating.

　The amount of potato starch to use is 3 tablespoons for 1 chicken thigh, and the coating will stick to your hands firmly like glue. Now the preparation process is all done.

2. How to fry the chicken

　When the chicken is prepared, we will fry them twice. Recently many cookbooks introduce this method of frying twice, because by doing this the chicken will become juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside.

　First heat the oil at the temperature of 160˚C to 170˚C. If you fry the chicken at 180˚C straight away, the chicken will be charred on the outside before the inside is cooked. Remember that the amount of soy sauce used for the marinade is more than the usual recipe and the coating contains that amount of soy sauce. You need to be careful when frying, as it will be easily charred.


After frying the chicken for about 5 minutes at 160˚C to 170˚C, take the chicken out to drain. Heat the oil to 190˚C and fry the second time until crisp for about 2 minutes and the karaage is ready to eat.
