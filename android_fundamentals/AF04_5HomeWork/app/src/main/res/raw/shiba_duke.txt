- 30 red perilla leaves (akajiso)
- 10g of salt (2% of the weight of the vegetables) for pickling the red perilla leaves

<PREPARATION>

1. Prepare the vegetables to be pickled

Prepare the summer vegetables of the season, as fresh as possible.

　First, cut the myoga in quarter length-ways, and the ginger into rather wide julienne strips.

　The eggplant will shrink a little when it is pickled, so cut in somewhat larger pieces and soak in water to remove the bitterness.

　Cut the cucumber in half length-ways and then slice diagonally into 5mm wide julienne strips.


2. Pickling the vegetables

　Put all the cut vegetables in a bowl and mix together.　Sprinkle indicated amount of salt and toss well.

　If you have a pickle press, put the vegetables in the container and press.　If you don’t, you can pressurize it by placing a weight of twice the weight of the vegetables on top.

　The liquid will be released instantly in about a day.　When this is done, go to the next process of pickling the red perilla leaves.


3. Pickling the red perilla leaves

　Add the indicated amount of salt to the red perilla leaves and rub well.　Squeeze firmly to remove the bitterness.

　After squeezing the red perilla leaves, add mirin and vinegar.　Before mixing the pickled vegetables and the red perilla leaves together, make sure to firmly squeeze the liquid out of the pickled vegetables.

　Otherwise, the shibazuke will have little taste.　Mix the red perilla leaves and the pickled vegetables and press again lightly.　The color of the red perilla leaves will soak into the vegetables and it will be ready to eat in 2 to 3 days.　Can be eaten deliciously up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator.
